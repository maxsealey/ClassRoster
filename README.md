Project: Class Roster
Course: WGU C867 (Scripting & Programming - Applications) Performance Assessment
Name: Max Sealey
Date Started: October 9th, 2022
Date Submitted: October 11th, 2022

Requirements:
 - In the main file, display author and course information.
 - Add data in the form of a string.
 - Create roster object with default constructor
 - Roster object parses the information for each student, creates a new Student object for each one, and stores as an array of pointers.
 - Roster class also has methods to print all of the student data, print emails that have been formatted incorrectly, print the average number of days spent in each course, print by degree program, and remove students by ID.
 
Functions and features I'm in the process of developing:
 - Read in data from a .csv file (which would include more student data: birthdate, gpa, grades, instructor names, course names).
 - Take user input to add/remove/edit/search students.
 - Organize student objects into a more efficient data structure for searching.
 - Ensure quality of information and input.
